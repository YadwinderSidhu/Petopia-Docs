      <h4>About PETOPIA</h4>
      <b>PETOPIA</b> was set up to provide dog owners with an alternative to leaving their ‘home alone' while they go to work or go on vacation - a safe, caring, and happy environment for their dogs.<br />
      Responsible dog owners want the best for their dogs – good care in a safe environment that can provide them with companionship and exercise. Dogs need stimulation to minimize issues such as separation anxiety and boredom, which can result in constant barking and destruction. Most people cannot take their dog to work or to other places where dogs are not allowed, but want to have peace of mind in knowing that their dogs are well taken care of until they can take care of them again.<br />
      <b>PETOPIA'</b>s owners are <b>Yun Jong Lee</b> and his wife <b>Joohee Lee.</b><br>

      <b>Yun Jong Lee</b> qualified as a veterinarian in Korea and worked as a vet for a Korean zoo. After coming to New Zealand he studied acupuncture and after qualifying he began running his own practice <a href="http://www.hanorientalclinic.com/" target="_blank">Han Oriental Clinic</a> in Johnsonville, Wellington. <br>

      His wife <b>Joohee Lee</b> is also a qualified veterinarian and worked as a vet in a small animal hospital in Korea. Since coming to New Zealand she also studied acupuncture, and has been providing veterinary services for the SPCA on a volunteer basis.<br />
      At <b>PETOPIA</b> she will be devoting her experience to the care and welfare of the animals.<br />
