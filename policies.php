      <b>Flea & Worm Prevention</b><br />
      All dogs must be on a flea, tick & worm preventative. We do not allow flea collars as they are toxic and hazardous to dogs if bitten or chewed. If, at any time during our care, a dog is noticed to have fleas, treatment will be applied and charged to the parents.<br />
     <b>Health</b><br />
      All dogs must be in good health. On admission, all dogs must be free from any condition that could potentially jeopardize other guests. We will not admit any dog that we believe, at our sole discretion, to be a risk to the other animals in our care. It is your responsibility as a parent to notify us of any health related issues affecting your dog so that we can make an informed determination about how to best care for your dog.<br />
      <b>Please do not bring your dog to Petopia if he or she has diarrhoea, a cough, vomiting, fever, worms, fleas, or has exhibited any signs of a contagious or infectious disease or illness</b>. If your dog is found to be sick, you or your emergency contact will be notified and your dog will be isolated until you can pick him or her up. Depending on the severity of the illness, we may also take your dog to the vet for further diagnosis and treatment.<br />
      <b>Injuries</b><br />
      Dogs are involved in play groups throughout their stay at Petopia. Play involves tug, fetch, chase or just wrestling with other dogs. Play can result in minor nicks, bumps/bruises or possible injury to joints, ligaments, tendons, etc. Owners will be notified upon pick-up of any "play injuries". Any serious problem will be addressed immediately. While every attempt to maintain a safe atmosphere is taken, dogs will be dogs. <b>In the event of an injury to your pet, we will take the necessary steps to care for your loved one, however all parents must assume all financial responsibility.</b><br />
      <b>Veterinary Care</b><br />
      At Petopia, our top priority is the health and safety of your dog. In the event your dog requires medical attention, we will make every effort to obtain the appropriate treatment for your dog in a timely manner. If we are unable to contact you for any reason, Petopia reserves the right to make decisions on your behalf for the well-being of your dog. Settlement for any veterinary bills that result from medical care for your dog will be your responsibility.<br />
      <b>Leashes, Collars & Identification Tags</b><br />
      All dogs are required to have a quick release or martingale collar with proper identification. An identification tag must be attached to your dog’s collar with a legible name and phone number. If your dog does not have the proper collar and ID tag, we will provide one at your expense. Please ensure that the collar is well fitted and that your dog cannot slip out of the collar. We do not accept choke chains, prong/pinch collars or shock collars at our facility. Although owners' leashes will not be used within the facility, dogs must be 
transported to and from Petopia with their own leashes. Petopia does not take any responsibility for any damage that may occur to your dog’s collar or leash while in our care.<br />
      <b>Toys, Blankets & Beds</b><br />
      Petopia will provide your dog with all the amenities including a dog bed, food bowls, toys and blankets. However if you wish to bring some of your dog’s belongings, that may make your dog feel more comfortable, you may do so. Please ensure that all personal belongings are named clearly with permanent marker, especially for blankets. Petopia <b>does not take any responsibility for any belongings that are lost due to poorly written </b>names or being unnamed.<br />
      <b>Food</b><br />
      Petopia will provide good quality food for your dog. However, different dogs eat different types of foods. If you wish, you can bring your dog’s own food. If your dog is on a special diet, or require specific foods, we encourage you to bring your dog’s own food.<br />
      This will help keep your dog’s dietary routine consistent, which helps minimize stress and prevents many digestive problems. When you bring in your own dog food, Petopia encourage <b>you package your dog's food in individual meal-sized portions. Each package should represent one meal, and each meal should be clearly marked with your dogs' name and any special instructions</b>. Pre-packing meals in this fashion ensures that our 
food supply is not depleted prematurely and that your dog is fed the usual amount.<br />
     <b>Missed meals</b><br />
      Due to the new environment and changes in routine, some dogs may not eat their meals while in a boarding situation. We will monitor each dog to determine if and how many meals they have missed. For the health and well-being of your dog, we would not want him or her to go more than 2 days without a meal. As such, we may add can food to your dog’s regular meal to entice him or her to eat. Given the amount of exercise and activity your dog gets at Petopia, it is important that we encourage our canine guests to eat.<br /> 	
     <b>Medications</b><br />
      Petopia is able to administer any oral or topical medication. All medication needs to be labelled by your veterinarian, with the dog’s full name. Please bring the Petopia Medication Form when you drop your dog off. We require you to bring at least two extra days of medication in case you need to extend your stay. In addition, please carefully review medication instructions with a Petopia staff member at the time of reservation and check-in. We will only administer medications in a safe and responsible manner. If you fail to comply with the above instructions we reserve the right to stop administering medications to your dog as a safety precaution. If we are unable to contact you, we will arrange to consult a veterinarian. In most cases, we will contact your dog’s regular veterinarian so long as (s)he is available. Any resulting charges are your responsibility and are due when you pick up your dog. Please remember to collect all unused medications at the time of pick-up.
