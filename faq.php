      All vaccinations are to be valid for the length of stay.<br>
      <b style="color:#16b99d">Fleas/Worms</b><br>
      Treating fleas and worms are very important for the health of all of our guests and your dogs as well.<br>
      Please ensure your dog is free from fleas or worms before bringing them to the kennel. If we need to treat your pet for fleas/worms, a charge will be incurred. <br>
      <b style="color:#16b99d">Will dog day care affect my dog?</b><br>
      The first few days of day care can make your dog a bit tired or sleepy from all the excitement of running around and playing. This is very normal and will fade over time, and we suggest you give your dog some rest when your dog gets home.<br>
      Regular visits to day care will actually improve both your dog’s mental and physical wellbeing. Your dog’s general health is monitored at all times and our facility is clean and hygienic as we use veterinary grade cleaning products.<br>
      Dogs may get the odd scratch or scrape from playing with others. Our staff are trained in pet first aid and will attend to your dogs needs and will inform you when you pick up your dog.<br>
      <b style="color:#16b99d">What happens if my dog becomes unwell or gets injured?</b><br>
      We will contact you as soon as your dog feels unwell or is injured and you can decide right away whether you want to come and pick your dog up and take it to your vet or you want us to do this for you. We also have a quarantine area to hold your dog until you can pick your dog up.<br>
      If your dog’s health deteriorates, we will find the best help available. The owner is responsible for any fees incurred, should veterinary care be required. All dogs are under our care, however, we do not accept any responsibility for illness, injury or loss. <br>
      <b style="color:#16b99d">Will dog day care affect my dog?</b><br>
      Just like people dogs sometimes have their “off” days. We provide a small "time out" session for dogs who need a bit of quiet time to settle down and then reintroduce them to their play group.
